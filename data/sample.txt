GraphRAG is a powerful retrieval-augmented generation system that combines the strengths of graph databases and vector search. It uses Neo4j for storing the knowledge graph structure and Qdrant for efficient vector similarity search.

The system works by first ingesting documents and breaking them into chunks. Each chunk is then processed in multiple ways:
1. The text is embedded using a sentence transformer model
2. Important terms and entities are extracted and stored in the graph
3. Relationships between entities are identified and added to the knowledge graph

When a query comes in, GraphRAG performs a hybrid search:
- Vector search finds semantically similar content
- Graph search identifies relevant connections
- The results are combined to provide comprehensive context for generation

This hybrid approach helps overcome the limitations of pure vector search, allowing for more precise retrieval based on the relationships between concepts.

The GraphRAG architecture consists of several components:
- An ingestion pipeline that processes documents
- A retrieval system that combines different search strategies
- A generation component that produces informative answers
